# KernelPatchSearch
The repo contains the basic scripts used for kernel patch numeric analysis in our paper "A Study of Persistent Memory Bugs in the Linux Kernel", which was published in the Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR), 2021 and in our journal "Understanding Persistent-Memory Related Issues in the Linux Kernel", which was published in ACM Transactions on Storage (TOS),2023.

By analyzing 1,350 PM related kernel patches in depth, we derive multiple insights in terms of PM patch categories, PM bug patterns, consequences, and fix strategies. Also, we leverage static analyze to identify Persistent Memory Driver issues. We hope our results could contribute to the development of effective PM bug detectors and robust PM-based systems.
